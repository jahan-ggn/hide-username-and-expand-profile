# Hide Username And Expand Profile

**Theme Summary**

This theme component hides the displayed username from user cards and user profiles to create a cleaner, less cluttered interface. It also forces the full user profile view to remain expanded, overriding the default collapsed behavior for a more detailed user experience.
